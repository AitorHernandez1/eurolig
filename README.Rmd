[![lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)

The eurolig package provides a set of tools to obtain and analyze basketball data from the Euroleague.

## Overview

* API wrapper around the official website of the [Euroleague](https://www.euroleague.net/).

* Functions to obtain stats, play-by-play data and shot location data in a tidy format within R.

* Tools to analyze and visualize the data.


## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("solmos/eurolig")
```


## Example

Let's say we want to analyze play-by-play data from the Championship game of the 2017-2018 season between Real Madrid and Fenerbache Dogus Istanbul. We can obtain the data by entering the game code and the season to the function `extract_pbp()`. The game code for the game can be found in the game's [URL](https://www.euroleague.net/main/results/showgame?gamecode=260&seasoncode=E2017).

```{r}
library(eurolig)
pbp <- extract_pbp(game_code = 260, season = 2017)
head(pbp)
```

From these data we can extract information about the assists in that game from, say, Real Madrid (MAD):
```{r}
assists <- get_assists(pbp, team = "MAD")
head(assists)
```

Moreover, eurolig provides some functions to visualize the data. We can use `plot_heatmap()` to show the distribution of assists among a given team. The package includes an example play-by-play data set of Real Madrid's entire 2017-2018 Euroleague season. We use these data to show Real Madrid's assists pattern on that season:

```{r}
data(mad2017)
plot_heatmap(mad2017, team = "MAD") +
    ggplot2::labs(title = "Real Madrid assist heatmap",
                  subtitle = "Euroleague 2017-2018")
```
